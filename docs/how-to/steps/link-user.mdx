## Introduction

To enable Buybase to make purchases on behalf of your users, we securely access and encrypt their e-commerce account session, including essential data like cookies and local storage. With Buybase Link, our hosted onboarding flow, users can link their e-commerce account session by interacting with a live browser stream preloaded with the platformâ€™s authentication form.

## Prerequisites

1. A Buybase User ID
2. Your Buybase App ID 
3. Your Buybase Developer ID

## Generating a Link

There are two ways Buybase links are generated:

1. **Error Response**

When making a purchase for a user without a linked session, your request will receive an error response. See [Buy Item](/api/buy-item/post) for API reference.

```json
{
    "error": "Session not found.",
    "message": "Buybase user (userId) for app (appId) is missing an Amazon session. Please direct them to the provided buybase link to create an Amazon session.",
    "buybase_link": "https://link.buybase.ai?platform=amazon&user_id=userId&developer_id=developerId&app_id=appId",
    "code": "SESSION_NOT_FOUND",
}
```

2. **Programmatically**

Or if you'd like to generate a link programmatically, you can make a GET request to the `/link` endpoint at anytime. See [Create Link URL](/api/link) for API reference.

```js
const options = {method: 'GET', headers: {authorization: '<your-api-key>'}};

fetch('https://api.buybase.ai/link?platform=amazon&user_id=userId&developer_id=developerId&app_id=appId', options)
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(response => console.log(response))
  .catch(err => console.error(err));
```
