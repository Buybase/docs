## Introduction

To enable Buybase to make purchases on behalf of your users, we securely access and encrypt their e-commerce account session, including essential data like cookies and local storage. With Buybase Link, our hosted onboarding flow, users can link their e-commerce account session by interacting with a live browser stream preloaded with the platformâ€™s authentication form.

## Prerequisites

1. A Buybase User ID
2. Your Buybase App ID 
3. Your Buybase Developer ID

## Generating a Link

There are two ways Buybase links are generated:

1. **Error Response**

When making a purchase for a user without a linked session, your request will receive an error response. See [Buy Item](/api/buy-item/post) for API reference.

```json
{
    "error": "Session not found.",
    "message": "Buybase user (userId) for app (appId) is missing an Amazon session. Please direct them to the provided buybase link to create an Amazon session.",
    "buybase_link": "https://link.buybase.ai?platform=amazon&user_id=userId&developer_id=developerId&app_id=appId",
    "code": "SESSION_NOT_FOUND",
}
```

Or for an expired session:

```json
{
  "error": "Expired Session",
  "message": "Amazon session is expired. Please re-authenticate your user.",
  "buybase_link": "https://link.buybase.ai?user_id=userId&developer_id=developerId&app_id=appId",
  "code": "EXPIRED_SESSION",
}
```

2. **Manually**

Or if you'd like to create a link manually, you can structure it with the following dynamic search params:

```
https://link.buybase.ai?platform={platform}&user_id={userId}&developer_id={developerId}&app_id={appId}
```
