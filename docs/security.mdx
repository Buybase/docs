### Zero Trust Model
1. **No Stored Credentials**: Buybase never stores user credentials or payment information. All sensitive data is handled through secure, encrypted sessions.
2. **Session-Based Security**: Each transaction processed through Buybase uses a unique, encrypted session containing the cookies and local storage of the user's logged-in state.
3. **Data Privacy**: We never share user data with third parties and only use data to provide our service. All sessions are encrypted at rest using AES-256 encryption.

### Compliance & Monitoring
1. **Regular Security Audits**: Our infrastructure undergoes regular security assessments and penetration testing.
2. **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of all API endpoints for suspicious activity.
3. **Automated Threat Detection**: Implementation of automated systems to detect and block potential security threats.

### Best Practices
1. Use environment variables for API keys 
2. Proxy all API requests through a secure server-side enviroment
3. Regularly rotate API keys
