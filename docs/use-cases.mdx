### Single Brand Shopping Agents
Buybase’s API paired with LLM service’s tool-calling capabilities, provides single-brand retailers with the perfect tech-stack to quickly launch competitive AI shopping agents—without the burden of maintaining or constantly innovating the underlying infrastructure that powers them.

### Multi-Brand Shopping Agents
Single-brand retailers can also choose to publish their stores on the Buybase network; This creates a network effect, enabling other AI shopping agents powered by Buybase to search and purchase products across multiple brands. This enables consumers to become “retailer-agnostic” and rely more on AI to aggregate information and facilitate purchases across many brands.
