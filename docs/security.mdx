### Security Architecture
1. **OAuth Authentication**: Buybase uses OAuth 2.0 to securely connect with e-commerce platforms like Shopify, eliminating the need to store merchant credentials directly.
2. **Secure Token Management**: Each storefront connection is managed through secure OAuth tokens that are encrypted and automatically rotated according to platform requirements.
3. **Data Privacy**: All data exchanged between Buybase and connected storefronts is encrypted at rest, with strict access controls and audit logging in place.

### Compliance & Monitoring
1. **Regular Security Audits**: Our infrastructure undergoes regular security assessments and penetration testing.
2. **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of all API endpoints for suspicious activity.
3. **Automated Threat Detection**: Implementation of automated systems to detect and block potential security threats.

### Best Practices
1. Use environment variables for API keys 
2. Proxy all API requests through a secure server-side enviroment
3. Regularly rotate API keys
